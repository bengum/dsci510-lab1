Invocation:
1) On github project page, click Code and Download ZIP.
2) Extract/unzip folder and copy folder location.
3) In Windows Command Prompt (windows+r, cmd), navigate to folder location (`$ cd` to change directory).
4) `$ jupyter run lab1.py`

I had trouble with the above until I reinstalled Anaconda to PATH, contrary to the install instructions.

Alternatively:
1) On github, navigate to lab1.py file.
2) Click Raw.
3) Select and Copy (ctrl-c) code.
4) Paste into Jupyter Notebook.
5) Shift-Enter to execute.

This feels clunky. Is there a better way?
