Invocation:
1) On github project page, click Code and Download ZIP.
2) Extract/unzip folder and copy folder location.
3) In a Jupyter Notebook cell, use Magic Command `%cd <folder location>` to change current working directory. Shift-Enter to execute.
4) In another cell, execute `%run lab1.py`.

Option B: (this seems wrong)
1) On github project page, click Code and Download ZIP.
2) Extract/unzip folder and copy folder location.
3) In Windows Command Prompt (windows+r, cmd), navigate to folder location (`$ cd` to change directory).
4) `$ jupyter run lab1.py`

I had trouble with Option B until I reinstalled Anaconda to PATH, contrary to the install instructions.

Option C: (this seems clunky)
1) On github, navigate to lab1.py file.
2) Click Raw.
3) Select and Copy (ctrl-c) code.
4) Paste into Jupyter Notebook.
5) Shift-Enter to execute.
